Redditing
=========

Reddit API client iOS App used for interviews.

Your coworker started this Reddit client app, but ran into some issues finishing it. It needs to be completed by the end of the sprint, so you are tasked with cleaning it up and adding a few nominal features.

1. Please refactor the code, and make sure it works. It should be pulling down posts from the ['aww' subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww).
2. Fetch the Reddit post's thumbnail and display it in the app next to each post's title.
3. We need to cater to other readers. Add another subreddit (any will do), and make it display in a second tab on screen.
4. Add something else fun to the project. It can be whatever you want.

Please zip the project back up when you're finished, and send it back to us. Be sure to call out #4 when you do!
